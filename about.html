   <h1>Why did I make this?</h1>
   <br>
   <p class="t4">Hi, my name is Demi. I'm a student of 2021 class in Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. I decided this topic for my final project because some of my friends are facing mental problem. Their parents thinks the will goes away soon so did not take it seriously. Although I tried my best to comfort them and support them,a friend of mine chose to end her life. I hope this website can be helpful. Also, I will come back and update when I come up more ideas.</p>
